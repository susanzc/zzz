## Waking up made easy.

All of our team members have struggled with waking up on time, especially as hardworking students in university. We decided to build an application that wakes you up in a fun yet effective way. It allows you to create alarms with no snooze button - instead, you have to solve a puzzle to shut it off. These puzzles include math problems with varying levels of difficulty, as well as song trivia from a user's selected Spotify playlist.
